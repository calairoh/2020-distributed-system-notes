\subsection{Data science}
\textbf{Data science} is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to \underline{extract knowledge and insights from data} in various forms, both structured and unstructured.\\
Data science is made possible by the increasing availability of large volumes of data, also called \textbf{Big Data}. Moreover, it's also became a \textbf{business model} for several companies which base their services on the data acquired and processed by their systems \textit{(e.g. Google, Facebook, ...)}.

\subsection{Big data}
In order to understand what big data are, we can refer to their main characteristics, also called "the four V's", which are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Volume}: we have a lot of data
    \item \textit{Velocity}: the data arrives fast and, moreover, information is relevant when it's "fresh"
    \item \textit{Variety}: the data arrives (and can be stored too) in many different formats
    \item \textit{Veracity}: the data is not always "correct", where with the term "correct" we intend that not all the data we acquire is relevant for the purpose we have
\end{itemize}
